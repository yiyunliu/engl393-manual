\begin{definition} Basil is native to tropical regions from central
Africa to Southeast Asia.[3] It is a tender plant, and is used in
cuisines worldwide. Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves
may taste somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, often sweet
smell.
\end{definition}

\begin{instruction}{Planting}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Basil needs a location that gets around 8 hours of sun a day
with a preferable air temperature of 80o F.
  \item Find or create a lot of rich and loamy soil at a temperature
of around 70o F.
  \item Keep soil moist and water often during dry periods.
  \item Surround the basil plantâ€™s stalk with mulch when the plant
grows to a height where its leaves will not make contact with the
ground. Mulch aides to keep soil moisture.
  \end{itemize}
